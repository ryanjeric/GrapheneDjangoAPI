# DJANGO WITH GRAPHENE API

## Introduction

> Django, the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines. It allows you to quickly prototype and build full web applications with less code.

>Last but not least, thereâ€™s Graphene and Graphene-Django, exposing a simple and powerful API for creating GraphQL servers.

>GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.








## Workspace Setup 
#### In the terminal, create a new virtual environment and activate it
```
$ virtualenv env
$ . env/bin/activate
 ```

#### With the virtual environment activated, run the following commands:
``` 
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Run migrate 
```
 $ python manage.py makemigrations
 $ python manage.py migrate
```
#### After that you can now run the Server using this command
```
$ python manage.py runserver *youcanspecifyporthere
```

### Some [manage.py] commands (```$ python manage.py```)
| Command | Usage |
